OVERVIEW AND USAGE

This repository provides plots contained in or supplemental to *cite*. If you use any of the
information provided in this repository, please cite *cite*.

CONTENTS

This repository contains three main folders, with each containing plots for each of the sets
of priors used in the Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling runs.

The folder "MCMC Plots" contains plots containing information about the specific Markov-chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs done. "Paper Plots" contains the plots in the main paper at *cite*, as well as
related plots with different MCMC priors. "Rotation Curves" contain plots of the galactic rotation
curves, containing both observed data and fits via the used models.

Within each of these folders, the subfolders of "Abundance Matching Prior", "Benchmark Analysis", and
"Mass-to-Light Ratio Prior" contain the respective plots to each of those three sets of MCMC priors examined.

In "MCMC Plots", each of these three subfolders contain further subfolders of "DC14", "NFW", and "SIDM",
containing the autocorrelation, corner, and step plots of the MCMC runs done for the respective dark
matter model.

UNCONVERGED GALAXIES

For each of the MCMC runs, there were a small number of galaxies that did not pass our test for autocorrelation.
These galaxies should be regarded as exceptions and be treated with extra care in any analysis. These galaxies
are tabulated below:
