OVERVIEW AND USAGE


This repository provides plots contained in or supplemental to *cite*. If you use any of the
information provided in this repository, please cite *cite*.

CONTENTS


The folder "MCMC Plots" contains plots containing information about the specific Markov-chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs done. "Paper Plots" contains the plots in the main paper at *cite*, as well as
related plots with different MCMC priors. "Rotation Curves" contain plots of the galactic rotation
curves, containing both observed data and fits via the used models.

Within each of these folders, the subfolders of "Abundance Matching Prior", "Benchmark Analysis", and
"Mass-to-Light Ratio Prior" contain the respective plots to each of those three sets of MCMC priors examined.

In "MCMC Plots", each of these three subfolders contain further subfolders of "DC14", "NFW", and "SIDM",
containing the autocorrelation, corner, and step plots of the MCMC runs done for the respective dark
matter model.
